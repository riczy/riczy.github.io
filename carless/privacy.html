This type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with (i.e., make a request to) the Services. We use internal tools and third party applications and services (like Google Analytics) to collect and analyze this information. Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c1">IP Address</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;) used to access the Services; some may be connected with your Account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldn&rsquo;t identify you or your Account). We may use this information about how you and others interact with the Services for a number of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new Services, including but not limited to: providing users with targeted advertising; fighting spam, malware, identity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for legal and safety reasons.</span></p><h3 class="c4"><a name="h.fqv1ektaxvh"></a><span>Information Related to Your Web Browser:</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each request you make to the Services, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account.

We may also ask you to provide information about your location. For example, when requested by you, we use your geolocation information from your mobile device to record your commuting activities.</span></p><h3 class="c4"><a name="h.uk50n95a4t00"></a><span>Information Collected Using Cookies and Web Tags: </span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cookies are text files that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can generally see your cookies through your browser settings, depending on what browser you&rsquo;re using. A web tag is code or a pixel embedded in a web page, or email, that allows CarLess or a third party to see that you have looked at that page. We use cookies and web tags to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services, as described above in &ldquo;Information Related to Use of the Services.&rdquo; Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don&#39;t combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in, and that your web browser has accessed the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one. We may also store unique or near-unique identifiers that we associate with your Account in our cookies. This information, in turn, is sometimes used as described above in &ldquo;Information Related to Use of the Services.&rdquo; Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won&#39;t be able to log into your Account, and so won&rsquo;t be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don&#39;t recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Some services that we use (including Third Party Services), such as </span><span class="c0 c9"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmQRPQF0YXFKiA1wREDv_OnYJXHQ">Google Analytics</a></span><span class="c0">, use web tags and may also place their own cookies on your browser.
