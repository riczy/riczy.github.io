<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="highlight">Last Modified: 2015-12-01</p>
<p>
Through our UseYourCarLess.com website and related CarLess mobile application, Riczy, LLC (&quot;<span class="emph">Riczy</span>,&quot; &quot;<span class="emph">CarLess</span>,&quot; &quot;<span class="emph">we</span>,&quot; &quot;<span class="emph">us</span>,&quot; or &quot;<span class="emph">our</span>&quot;) takes the private nature of your information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the &quot;<span class="emph">Privacy Policy</span>&quot;) describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use UseYourCarLess.com (the &quot;<span class="emph">Site</span>&quot;) and/or CarLess's other domains, products, services, and/or content, including our mobile applications (collectively with the Site, the &quot;<span class="emph">Services</span>&quot;). When you use the Services, you also consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.
</p>

<h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, or businesses (&quot;<span class="emph">Third Party Services</span>&quot;). While we try to work only with those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don&#39;t take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.</p>

<h2>What We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
<h3>Account Information</h3>
<p>When you create an account on the Services (an &quot;<span class="emph">Account</span>&quot;), we'll ask you for information such as your username, password, age, and email address (&quot;<span class="emph">Account Information</span>&quot;). We may use Account Information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as by personalization. We use your age to verify that you can lawfully use the Services. We use your email address to verify your Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below.</p>

<h3>Email Communications with Us</h3>
<p>As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your Account Settings page or by using the &quot;Opt-Out&quot; link in the emails themselves. <span class="emph">Note that we will </span><span class="emph underline">never</span><span class="emph"> email you to ask for your password or other Account Information.</span></p>

<h3>Information Related to Use of the Services</h3>
<p>We collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an Account. This type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with (i.e., make a request to) the Services. We use internal tools and third party applications and services (like Google Analytics) to collect and analyze this information. Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (&quot;<span class="emph">IP Address</span>&quot;) used to access the Services; some may be connected with your Account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldn't identify you or your Account). We may use this information about how you and others interact with the Services for a number of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new Services, including but not limited to: providing users with targeted advertising; fighting spam, malware, identity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for legal and safety reasons.</p>

<h3>Information Related to Your Web Browser</h3>
<p>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each request you make to the Services, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. We use web browser-related information to enhance and improve the Services.</p>

<h3>Location Information</h3>
<p>In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation. We may also ask you to provide information about your location. For example, when requested by you, we use your geolocation information from your mobile device to record your commuting activities.</p>

<h3>Information Collected Using Cookies and Web Tags</h3>
<p>Cookies are text files that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can generally see your cookies through your browser settings, depending on what browser you're using. A web tag is code or a pixel embedded in a web page, or email, that allows CarLess or a third party to see that you have looked at that page. We use cookies and web tags to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services, as described above in &quot;Information Related to Use of the Services.&quot; Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in, and that your web browser has accessed the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one. We may also store unique or near-unique identifiers that we associate with your Account in our cookies. This information, in turn, is sometimes used as described above in &quot;Information Related to Use of the Services.&quot; Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into your Account, and so won't be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Some services that we use (including Third Party Services), such as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmQRPQF0YXFKiA1wREDv_OnYJXHQ">Google Analytics</a>, use web tags and may also place their own cookies on your browser. Unless otherwise disclosed, this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.</p>

<h2>With Whom Your Information Is Shared</h2>
<p>We never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this Privacy Policy); or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.</p>

<h3>Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request</h3>
<p>If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.</p>

<h3>Information Shared with Other Third Parties</h3>
<p>We may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information, or other non-personally identifying information with people and entities that we do business with.</p>

<h2>The Security of Your Information</h2>
<p>Your Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password and limiting access to your computer, browser and mobile devices by signing off or locking your devices after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.</p>

<p>We seek to protect your information (including your Account Information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

<h2>How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account</h2>
<p>If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your <span class="emph">Account Settings</span> page. Deleting your Account may not fully remove the content you have published from our systems, as caching of, backups of, copies of, or references to your Account Information may not be immediately removed.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for modifications set forth in our <span class="emph">Terms of Service</span>. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>

<h2>Where to Direct Questions or Concerns</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, <span class="c8"><a href="mailto:contact@riczy.com">send</a></span> us a detailed message.</p>
